🧠 67Detector — Meme-Inspired Hand Movement Detection Using Python

67Detector is a playful yet technically robust Python project that detects specific hand movements or gestures in real time using computer vision.
Originally inspired by the viral “67” meme, this project transforms the humor into a working gesture recognition system powered by OpenCV and MediaPipe.

🚀 Features

Detects and tracks hand movements in real time
Built using OpenCV and MediaPipe for accurate landmark detection
Lightweight and runs easily on most systems
Inspired by the “67” meme — detects the gesture for fun visualization or reaction

🧩 Requirements

Install the required libraries before running:
pip install opencv-python mediapipe

▶️ How to Run
python handmovement.py

Make sure your webcam is connected — the program will open a live window and start detecting your hand movements.

📂 File Structure
hand_movement.py/
 └── handmovement.py   # Main Python script

💡 Future Ideas

Train a model to classify more gestures (e.g., “67”, peace sign, thumbs up)
Add voice or sound reactions when a specific gesture is detected
Integrate with games or robotic controls for interactive fun
